Hi!  I am Malte Dehling, a mathematician with in interest in technology, both
old and new.

Recently I have spent some time reverse engineering and modifying the firmware
for some older SUN Microsystems framebuffers.  Check out some of my pinned
repositories if you're interested and shoot me an email if you have any
questions!
